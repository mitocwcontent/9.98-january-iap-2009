Lectures: 1 session / week, 1 hour / session

Course Description
------------------

The neuropharmacology course will discuss the drug-induced changes in functioning of the nervous system. The specific focus of this course will be to provide a description of the cellular and molecular actions of drugs on synaptic transmission. This course will also refer to specific diseases of the nervous system and their treatment in addition to giving an overview of the techniques used for the study of neuropharmacology.

Lecture Schedule
----------------

Four 1 hour lectures in January.

Course Prerequisites and Requirements
